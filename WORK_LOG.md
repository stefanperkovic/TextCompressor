| December 2  |    2 - 3     |                       I discussed ideas on how to approach solving this problem set with the people at my table and the class. We discussed implementing a way to have a code correspond to common words that we would store in a hashmap.This way when we see these common words we can store them with a lot smaller bit-code to represent the words. |
| December 4  | 12:40 - 1:40 |                I worked on implementing a compression algorithm that tracks unique words using two arrays: one for the words and another for their occurrences. I brainstormed how to handle marking new words versus referencing existing ones in the compressed output. This initial version focused on simplicity and correctness over optimization. |
| December 5  |   4:30 - 5   |     I have finished the identification of unique words and their occurances in the text. I first input the text as a string and then put all the words into an array. I go through that find all unique words adding them to an array and while also keep count of their occurances. Now i will try to compress by assigning codes to the common words. |
| December 5  |   5 - 5:30   |     Implemented a search algorithm to find the 10 most common words in our text. I iterated through the occurrences array to identify the most frequent word and then stored it in the mostCommonWords array and then marked it as processed by setting its occurrence count to -10000. Next I will look at how to give them corresponding short codes. |
| December 10 | 9:15 - 9:45  |                        Intialized the TST with all the codes converting them to Strings and inserting them in the tree. Loop through the entire text string and am adding all of the codes to the write out. I get the longestprefix and use that to find the codeword. Next I will add the edge case for the problem set and get that if statement in. |
| December 10 | 7:50 - 8:20  |                                                I added an the if statement to make sure that when we are looking at the look ahead code that we are inside the boundaries of the text and we haven't created more than the max amount of codes. Made multiple other minor debugs and also made sure to cut the string evertime we add a certain prefix. |
| December 10 |   8:30 - 9   | I implemented the expand() function by initializing a codeTable array to store the strings corresponding to each code. I then set up a loop to read compressed codes and retrieve the corresponding string from the codeTable while also handling the edge case where a new code is encountered by appending the first character of the current string. |
| December 11 |   2:30 - 3   |     I replaced all of my substrings in compress with instead going through the text using the index. This is because substring is vastly inneficient as it does a linear search throughout the whole text. I also did a lot of work on my expand where I have the currentstring and the nextstring in order to make it easier to handler the edge case. |
