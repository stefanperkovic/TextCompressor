| December 2 |    2 - 3     |                   I discussed ideas on how to approach solving this problem set with the people at my table and the class. We discussed implementing a way to have a code correspond to common words that we would store in a hashmap.This way when we see these common words we can store them with a lot smaller bit-code to represent the words. |
| December 4 | 12:40 - 1:40 |            I worked on implementing a compression algorithm that tracks unique words using two arrays: one for the words and another for their occurrences. I brainstormed how to handle marking new words versus referencing existing ones in the compressed output. This initial version focused on simplicity and correctness over optimization. |
| December 5 |   4:30 - 5   | I have finished the identification of unique words and their occurances in the text. I first input the text as a string and then put all the words into an array. I go through that find all unique words adding them to an array and while also keep count of their occurances. Now i will try to compress by assigning codes to the common words. |
