| December 2 |    2 - 3     |                   I discussed ideas on how to approach solving this problem set with the people at my table and the class. We discussed implementing a way to have a code correspond to common words that we would store in a hashmap.This way when we see these common words we can store them with a lot smaller bit-code to represent the words. |
| December 4 | 12:40 - 1:40 |            I worked on implementing a compression algorithm that tracks unique words using two arrays: one for the words and another for their occurrences. I brainstormed how to handle marking new words versus referencing existing ones in the compressed output. This initial version focused on simplicity and correctness over optimization. |
| December 5 |   4:30 - 5   | I have finished the identification of unique words and their occurances in the text. I first input the text as a string and then put all the words into an array. I go through that find all unique words adding them to an array and while also keep count of their occurances. Now i will try to compress by assigning codes to the common words. |
| December 5 |   5 - 5:30   | Implemented a search algorithm to find the 10 most common words in our text. I iterated through the occurrences array to identify the most frequent word and then stored it in the mostCommonWords array and then marked it as processed by setting its occurrence count to -10000. Next I will look at how to give them corresponding short codes. |
