| December 2 | 2 - 3 | I discussed ideas on how to approach solving this problem set with the people at my table and the class. We discussed implementing a way to have a code correspond to common words that we would store in a hashmap. This way when we see these common words we can store them with a lot smaller bit-code to represent the words. |
